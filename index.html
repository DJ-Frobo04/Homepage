      <h2>&#127752;About me</h2>

      <p>My name is DJ Klefeker. I'm from Fairfield/Hamilton, Ohio. I'm trans and my pronouns are She/Her. I currently attend the University of Cincinnati in Blue Ash, and I'm majoring in Applied Media Communications. I'm currently in the first semester of my sophomore year. </p>

      <p>I have multiple pets. This is because I have two different houses I live in. One for my Mom, and the other one for my Dad. At my Mom's house I have one beagle named Daisy. I used to have a second dog there named Faith, but she unfortunately passed away almost a year ago. At my Dad's house I have two cats named Olive and Commet, and two dogs named Maggie and Poppy. </p>

      <p>In my free time I enjoy drawing, watching cartoons, and listening to music. Some of my favorite shows include <i>Spectacular Spider-Man</i>, <i>Amphibia</i>, <i>My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic</i>, and many more. I tend to listen to a very diverse range of music genres. The two most common ones I listen to are pop and rock music. Below are my top five artists: </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Green Day</li>
        <li>My Chemical Romance</li>
        <li>Chappel Roan</li>
        <li>Lady Gaga</li>
        <li>The Midnight</li>
      </ol>

      <p>I'm really into art and animation. Some time I'd like to possibly be a storyboard artist for an animation studio, either mainstream or indie. I've been doing my own sketches and drawings, both original and non-original, since I was in 6<sup>th</sup> grade. Since then some of my drawings have gotten more complex. Here's one of my orginal ones.</p>
